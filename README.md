# Cointregration for Stat Arb and Pairs Trading

# Abstract 
The general idea of what pairs trading is, is pretty well established. At first glance we simply define it as trading the spread between two conintregrated assets, however with in modern-day pairs trading, it can involve  a variety of assets, with a varying degree of long and short exposures. Likewise the condition of having stationary or cointegrates assets (for that matter), is no longer a requirment.
